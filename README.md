# horizontal_scrolling
this repository provides a web framework based on a basic css html js structure, with some functions written in javascript and jquery which allow horizontal scrolling and a bit more. --- > horizontal swiping, snapping position of sections, scrolling moment, swiping horizontally and dragging the screen also horizontally with the mouse.

it has been written and shared by Andr√©s Villa Torres beginning 2018, for the Kreativ Kollektiv HAUSAMMEHR

this is no library rather a few functions and variables wrapped in a small framework for you to keep on developing or making use of the template to start your own project.

any questions hit me a message, happy to help
Andres
