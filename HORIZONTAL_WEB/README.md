#Template created for HAUSAMMEHR KREATIV KOLLEKTIV, by ndr3svt

Template developed at Atelier Gerold, Zurich by Andres, and provided for free use on a horizontal scrollable website, preferably in non commercial projects, please be fair and use this wisely, also if improvements don't hesitate updating branches on the github repository. Thanks and enjoy.

Several functions in js allow to scroll, swipe or drag horizontally over a web page.
